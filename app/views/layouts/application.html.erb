      <h3>Go Outside</h3>
      <p>I love being outside. While I like to actually <strong>do</strong> lots of things outside, just the act of <em>being</em> outside is amazing on it's own. I'm not sure if its the air, the beauty, or just the sense of freedom, but there is just something about being outside.</p>
      <ol>
        <lh>The purpose of this webpage is twofold:</lh>
        <li>
          To solidify to you, dear reader, that being outside is indeed awesome.
        </li>
        <li>
          To actually convince you to go outside.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        This picture you are so immersed in was in fact taken by me, while being outside. The beauty, expanse, and mystery of nature can only really be experienced outside.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <lh>Here is why:</lh>
        <li>
          Outside is where the air we breath comes from.
        </li>
        <li>
          Seriously what other reason do you need?
        </li>
        <li>
          You are forced to leave behind at least some of the distractions of technology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Outside if beautiful.
        </li>
        <li>
           Youâ€™ll feel better and be happier. Science says so.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p> So what are you waiting for?</p>
